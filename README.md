# __RPG: Random Password Generator__

## __Introduction__
___

As a developer, I often need to change some of my passwords randomly.

This app provides a random password generated depending on the characters we want to include and the size we indicate.

As password options, it is possible to choose between:
+ Uppercase
+ Lowercase
+ Numbers
+ Special characters

As characters long, between 8 and 32 characters.

With just one click, we can copy the generated password into the clipboard.

#### *__IMPORTANT:__ I am not responsible for what may happen when using the passwords generated in this App. If you want to verify the security level of the password generated, you can use one of the many websites, such as for example: https://password.kaspersky.com/*

## __About the App__
